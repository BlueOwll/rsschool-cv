## Profile
I worked for a while in a field almost unrelated to programming, but now I decided to do something that interests me more. I aim to become a full-stack developer, for example, in projects related to collecting and processing distributed data.  
Learning the front-end is a good start.   
I am well motivated to gain new knowledge and ultimately participate in the implementation of a project that is useful for people.
