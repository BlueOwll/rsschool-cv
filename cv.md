## Profile
I worked for a while in a field almost unrelated to programming, but now I decided to do something that interests me more. I aim to become a full-stack developer, for example, in projects related to collecting and processing distributed data.  
Learning the front-end is a good start.   
I am well motivated to gain new knowledge and ultimately participate in the implementation of a project that is useful for people.

## Skills
* Basics of Markdown, HTML
* Basics of JavaScript
* Basics of SQL (PostgreSQL) for data analysis
* Git/GitHub

## Code example
```
function solution(number){
  let res = 0
  for (let i = 1; i < number; i++)
    if (i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0) {
      res = res + i
    }
    return res
}
```

## Experience
* Small project (for IoT data processing) porting from C++ to Android (using Android Studio)

## Education 
Bauman University
